   * "Copy link", the one item every shareable thing's menu carries.

   * The confirmation lives on the item, which is why the menu does not close
   * on click: a copy with no feedback is indistinguishable from a dead
   * control. A copy that landed turns its glyph into a foam check and closes
   * the menu shortly after, through the menu's own close, so the trigger gets
   * its focus back; a refused write stays up and says so — the item is also
   * the retry. The item dies with its menu, and so do its state and its timer.
