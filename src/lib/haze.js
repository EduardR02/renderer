   THE HAZE — arithmetic

   One picture of what is playing sits behind every panel, and the panels
   are glass over it (Ambient.svelte, haze.worker.js). This module is the
   part of that which is arithmetic: where each pixel of the haze takes its
   light from, how bright it may be, and how it is quantised. Pure
   functions, so the worker and the tests share them.

   The haze is the picture itself, seen through soft glass — its shapes,
   edges and gradients, not a few blobs of its colour. The source is read
   at a real resolution and GRADED first, pixel by pixel in Oklab: keyed low
   against its own median, so a light picture keeps its light and shade and
   a dark one its mood, with chroma kept and the fine detail laid back over
   the compressed range (local contrast). Then it is LAID OUT: under the
   video exactly as the video shows it, and to its left as its own mirror
   image — continuous at the video's edge — magnified with distance, so the
   window is one large view of the picture rather than repeated copies.
   Then it is blurred lightly, once, and held under the ceilings.

   Blur happens in LINEAR light, as a lens does it: a convex mix of linear
   colours is never brighter than its brightest input, so the ceilings hold
   through it; the chroma the mix cancels is given back. Quantisation to 8
   bits is dithered, which is what keeps a dark gradient stretched over a
   window from breaking into bands.

   TWO RENDERERS draw it. The GPU's (haze-gl.js) is the one the worker
   uses; renderHaze here, on the CPU, is the reference it is checked
   against and the fallback where WebGL2 cannot be had. They are one
   pipeline: what both need before a pixel is drawn — where the picture
   is, the part of the source it frames, the source's statistics, the
   layout's columns, the seam — is worked out here (prepare), and every
   calibrated number lives here once: the CPU reads it directly and the
   shaders are handed it as #defines (TUNING), so the two cannot drift.
