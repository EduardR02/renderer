/**

/**
 * A memo and a concurrency-limited queue in front of an async reader.
 *
 * `read` is what one value costs to work on — decoding a cover to read its
 * colour, here. Two of those run per image otherwise: `coverTone` keys its own
 * cache by the whole pool of urls, which is right, because four cells are one
 * answer — but it means one file answers to several keys. The memo is keyed
 * per url, so the second ask shares the first one's promise instead of
 * decoding the same picture again.
 *
 * The queue is the other half. A library page mounts two hundred cards and
 * asks for every one of their colours at once; started together, the covers
 * nobody is looking at take the browser's decode queue ahead of the ones on
 * screen. `limit` reads run at a time and the rest wait their turn in the
 * order they were asked for, so the top of a list is served first.
 *
 * @param read  `(value) => Promise` — the work for one value
 * @param max   results the memo keeps, oldest evicted first
 * @param limit reads allowed to run at once
 * @returns `(key, value) => Promise`
