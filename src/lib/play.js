 * is the single one.
 *
 * `busy` is the caller's own `$state({ id: "" })` slot: runes cannot live in a
 * plain `.js` module, so the view owns the reactive object and hands over the
 * proxy — mutations here stay reactive in the view's template. `load` is a
 * thunk so callers with arguments close over them. Returns the message to
 * display ("" on success or when `stillCurrent` says the caller has moved on),
 * so the view keeps one `error = await cardPlay(...)` line.
