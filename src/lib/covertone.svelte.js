/* =====================================================================
   CONTENT COLOUR

   The palette owns the chrome; the artwork owns the content. Everything in
   this module exists to answer one question — "what colour is this record?" —
   and to answer it in a form the interface can actually use.

   Two rules make that safe:

     1. Only the HUE comes from the picture. Lightness and chroma are imposed
        here, at fixed targets, so a white sleeve cannot produce a white header
        and a neon one cannot produce a neon header. The app stays as dark as
        it was designed to be, and every page is a different colour anyway.
        The hue is not quite untouched either: `warpHue` folds one arc of the
        wheel away, the arc that has no dark form at all. That is the only
        place a sleeve is overruled, and it is 118° out of 360.

     2. Nothing here is allowed to fail loudly. A cross-origin refusal, a
        decode error, a cover that never arrives — each one falls through to a
        deterministic hue derived from the entity id, which is also what the
        generated identity tile uses, so a coverless playlist still has a
        colour and it is the same colour as its tile.

   Why this and not a palette tint: a translucent pastel over near-black is
   always a dark low-chroma smear — that is arithmetic, not taste, and it is
   exactly how the old 20%-rose header wash turned brown. A colour picked at a
   fixed dark lightness and a real chroma never does that.
