     `rows` is the current track followed by the engine's own upcoming plan, so

  /* ---------------- Windowed rendering ----------------
     Same scheme as TrackList: a fixed-height body preserves the queue's full
     geometry while an absolute-index-keyed window is translated through it.
     Sliding by one row retains every overlapping row/Cover subtree and only
     removes and adds the boundary rows. The scroller is an ancestor (.scroll
     in App.svelte), not this component, so the offset has to be read from it
     rather than from a local scrollTop.
     The queue differs from a playlist table in one way: the engine re-sends
     the whole queue (a fresh array) on every change, so identity changes on
     the queue's own edits too. Those keep the window — a move/remove/play-from
     here must not yank the scroll — while a queue that no longer contains the
     visible tracks is a genuinely new context and resets to the top.
     The rows are queue indexes, which mean nothing once the queue behind them
     is replaced, so the alignment check keeps the queue those indexes belonged
     to and resolves both sides to track identity. */
