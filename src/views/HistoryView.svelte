     rather than running here: a local filter would have to pull every row

     the library already holds the names, so no request is added for it. A
     playlist that is no longer in the library (or an album/artist/radio, whose

     COLUMNS

     The same shape as the track table's, deliberately: a small quiet column,
     the artwork, the title carrying the row, one context column, and a
     trailing measure. History's small quiet leading column is the CLOCK,
     because the clock is what identifies a row here in the way an ordinal
     identifies a row in a playlist — this is a journal, and a journal is read
     down its dates.

     Moving it there is also what fixed the balance. With the time on the right
     the row ran title, then 200px of nothing, then three narrow cells jammed
     against the pane edge. Now the title has the middle, and both edges carry
     something the width of a word.

     Measured against the PANE, not the window — the same reason the track
     table does: the space this list has is the window minus the rail, minus
     the inspector when it is open, minus the gutters, and a viewport media
     query doing that arithmetic by hand gets it wrong.

     DROP ORDER, context before identity: the source goes first, then the
     measure. The clock, the artwork and the title never leave.

     Each threshold is the width at which its column stops fitting — 88 + 36 +
     a 200px title + the column itself + the gaps + the row's padding — rather
     than a round number. They were 700 and 560, both about a hundred pixels
     early, which is what left a narrow pane showing a title and then a third

     a full play runs all the way through to rose. The further a play got, the
