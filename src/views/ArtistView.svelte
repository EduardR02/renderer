  /**
   * The artist page: who this is, what to play, and one shelf of records.
   *
   * The redesign folded the whole discography reader into this page, so an
   * artist page was a several-screen scroll through every track of every
   * release. That is a different job. This page INTRODUCES an artist — the
   * portrait, the songs people actually play, and one row of covers you can
   * recognise a record from — and hands the reading to `discography`.
   *
   * The shelf is ONE row, not four. The pre-redesign page stacked a separate
   * shelf for Albums, Singles, Compilations and Appears-on, each with its own
   * "Show all". The segmented toggle now covers only the three main catalogue
   * groups; Appears On lives in its own lazy shelf near the bottom. "See all"
   * carries a regular catalogue selection into the reader; ranked Popular
   * releases open the reader on "All" because that order only exists in this
   * overview payload. Every release on the main shelf comes out of the artist
   * payload. Regular groups carry per-type summaries; ranked Popular releases
   * come from the overview.

  THE PICK CARD — one card, three kinds, and the affordance is the difference.

  This section used to render the square shelf card, which was only ever
  reachable for a pinned playlist because the browse contract dropped every
  other kind. A pin is not a shelf item: there is exactly one of it, it is the
  artist SAYING something, and it can carry their words. So it is a wide frame
  with the artwork at a fixed 76px and the copy given the room instead — which
  is also the shape that lets a pinned song sit beside a pinned album without
  either looking like a mistake.
