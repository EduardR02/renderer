//! The artists the signed-in account follows.
//!
//! Transport: `GET /user-profile-view/v3/profile/{username}/following` over
//! spclient, which the session authenticates for us with its own bearer and
//! client token. No developer app, no second credential, no extra login —
//! which is the binding constraint on this whole feature.
//!
//! Two things about this endpoint were established by probing the owner's
//! live account, and both contradict what this module used to say:
//!
//! - The collection holds ARTISTS, not users. An older comment here claimed
//!   `/following` was the set of *users* you follow and used that claim to
//!   justify a different transport entirely. It is wrong: the live response
//!   is `{"profiles": [{"uri": "spotify:artist:…", "name", "image_url",
//!   "followers_count", "is_following"}]}`. The uri is nevertheless the field
//!   the id is derived from, and entries are filtered on the artist prefix,
//!   because a profile collection could plausibly carry `spotify:user:` rows
//!   and a user rendered as an artist tile would open a page that does not
//!   exist.
//! - `image_url` is a plain https URL, not the `spotify:image:` /
//!   `spotify:mosaic:` form the metadata surfaces in this codebase return.
//!   It is passed through as-is.
//!
//! Why not Spotify's public Web API (`api.spotify.com/v1/me/following`),
//! which this module was originally built on: it does not work and cannot be
//! made to. That edge requires a token issued through the accounts OAuth flow
//! and bound to a registered application; the login5 bearer is minted for
//! Spotify's internal services and carries no client registration, so the
//! request is refused. It is refused as **429 Too Many Requests**, which is
//! the trap — the previous implementation mapped that to "Spotify is
//! rate-limiting this account" and so reported a permanent, structural
//! refusal as a transient one. Registering an application is out of scope, so
//! that transport is a dead end for this project.
//!
//! There is no write path here, and adding one is not a small job. Following
//! an artist is not a social-graph operation: `socialgraph/v2/following` and
//! `socialgraphv2.proto` (symbols `followUser`, `followUsers`,
//! `FollowedUsers`) are the *user* follow graph. Following an ARTIST is a
//! collection write — `collection/v2/write`, with
//! `collection/artist_collection_state.proto` — and both services speak
//! protobuf, which is why every `format=json` probe against them answered
//! 400. librespot 0.8 ships neither schema, so a write would mean vendoring
//! and maintaining descriptors for an undocumented internal service. Until
//! that is worth doing, this app reads who you follow and the official client
//! is where you change it.
//!
//! Paging: none. Nine entries came back in one response with no cursor field
//! of any kind, and the request carries no page parameter that was observed
//! to do anything. Inventing a cursor that cannot be verified would be a
//! guess dressed as a contract, so the read is one round trip and the whole
//! collection is whatever that answers with. If a large account turns out to
//! be truncated, the fix is to find out how this service actually pages —
//! not to add an `after=` and hope.
