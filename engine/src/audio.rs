//! Lazy, immediate-pause cpal output for librespot.
//!
//! Construction checks presence without opening a stream. First playback opens
//! output; pause stops the native stream rather than running a silent mixer.
//! The callback cursor and device's submitted buffer survive pause,
//! together with queued packets, WSOLA overlap and rational resampler history.
//! Loads and seeks invalidate retained audio; natural boundaries remain gapless.
//!
//! Processing happens before the ring, at the device rate. The callback only
//! converts sample representation/channel layout and applies transport gain:
//! packet boundaries cannot reset the rational resampling phase.
//!
//! librespot can exit the process on start/stop errors, so those methods always
//! succeed. Native opening is deadline-bounded on a detached worker; failures
//! notify the engine even without a subsequent write. Ring writes are bounded
//! too, so dead output cannot wedge the player thread.
